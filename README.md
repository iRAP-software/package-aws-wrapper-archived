AWS Wrapper for PHP
========================

This package aims to wrap around Amazons PHP sdk so that it provides the developer with a more object-orientated interface. Thus the developer will spend less time looking up the parameters they can pass into an array.
This version of the wrapper is based on [version 3 of the SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/api/).
